## More ?
You have worked on a previous version of Jasmine (2.4.1 and customized) and the specs have been specifically defined according to your JS background, if you want to go further I advise you to go directly to the Jasmine website and look at the current version, you will be able to deepen things with examples of other specs if needed.
